/**
 * Describes the necessity for this attribute type within the feature type.  Possible values are:   * `REQUIRED` - The attribute for the attribute type must be                  provided whenever the feature is provided (e.g.:                  \"PASSPORT_NUMBER\" is required with the \"PASSPORT\"                  feature).   * `SUFFICIENT` - If no attributes for `REQUIRED` attribute types                    are provided for the feature, then at least one                    marked `SUFFICIENT` must be provided (e.g.:                    \"NAME_FULL\" or \"NAME_ORG\" for the \"NAME\" feature)   * `PREFERRED` - Attributes of `PREFERRED` attribute types are                   optional, but providing them greatly enhances                   accuracy for scoring and matching purposes (e.g.:                   a \"PASSPORT_COUNTRY\" for \"PASSPORT\" feature)   * `OPTIONAL` - Attributes of `OPTIONAL` attribute types are                  optional and do not significantly affect accuracy                  for scoring and matching purposes, but do provide                  additional information (e.g.: \"PASSPORT_ISSUE_DT\"                  for the \"PASSPORT\" feature)
