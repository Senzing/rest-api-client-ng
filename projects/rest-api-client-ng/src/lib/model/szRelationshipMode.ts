/**
 * Senzing REST API
 * This is the Senzing REST API.  It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at [https://docs.senzing.com](https://docs.senzing.com). <br><br> <b>NOTE:</b> Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the `text/event-stream` media type.  This support is activated by adding the `Accept: text/event-stream` header to a request to override the default `application/json` media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce `progress` events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its `200` response schema. Upon success, the final event will be `completed` with the same response schema as a `200` response.  Upon failure, the final event will be `failed` with same schema as the `4xx` or `5xx` response (typically the `SzErrorResponse`) [https://docs.senzing.com](https://docs.senzing.com)

/**
 * Controls how to handle the first-degree related entities.  The possible values are:   * `NONE` - Do not include any data on first-degree related entities --      this is the fastest option from a performance perspective because      related entities do not have to be retrieved.   * `PARTIAL` - **(default value)** Include only partial stub      information for related entities with the `partial` property of the      `SzRelatedEntity` instances set to `true`.  Obtaining additional      information requires subsequent API calls.   * `FULL` - Include full data on the first-degree related entities.      This option obtains entity network at one degree for the requested      entity and will fully populate up to 1000 related entities and sets      the `partial` property of those `SzRelatedEntity` instances to      `false`.  Related entities beyond the first 1000 will be left      incomplete and have their `partial` property will be set to `true`.
