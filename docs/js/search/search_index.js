An application may exclude displaying these as options if these things are being auto-generated or automatically selected for the user.  You may want to contact Senzing support before leveraging advanced attribute types in your application.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        attributeClass\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        attributeClass:         SzAttributeClass\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         SzAttributeClass\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        attributeCode\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        attributeCode:         string\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         string\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The unique string that identifies the attribute type among all other attribute types.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        defaultValue\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        defaultValue:         string\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         string\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The default value assumed for the attribute when it is not provided but is required as part of a feature.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        featureType\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        featureType:         string\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         string\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    Identifiers the feature type that this attribute type is an attribute of (if any).

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto

REST API.  It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto

the Senzing REST API.  It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\nDo not edit the class manually.\n\n            \n\n\n        \n            Index\n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Properties\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        dataSourceCode\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        dataSourceId\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n            \n                Properties\n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        dataSourceCode\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        dataSourceCode:         string\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         string\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The data source code.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        dataSourceId\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        dataSourceId:         number\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         number\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The data source ID.

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\nDo not edit the class manually.\n\n            \n\n\n        \n            Index\n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Properties\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        entityClassCode\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        entityClassId\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        resolving\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n            \n                Properties\n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        entityClassCode\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        entityClassCode:         string\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         string\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The entity class code.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        entityClassId\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        entityClassId:         number\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         number\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The entity class ID.

Senzing REST API\nThis is the Senzing REST API.  It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\nDo not edit the class manually.\n\n            \n\n\n        \n            Index\n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Properties\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        endEntityId\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        entityIds\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        startEntityId\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n            \n                Properties\n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        endEntityId\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        endEntityId:         number\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         number\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The ending entity ID for the path.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        entityIds\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        entityIds:     Array\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :     Array\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The array of entity IDs identifying the entities on the path in order of how are they are connected on the path.

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\nDo not edit the class manually.\n\n            \n\n\n        \n            Index\n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Properties\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        addressData\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        characteristicData\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        dataSource\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        identifierData\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        nameData\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        originalSourceData\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        otherData\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        phoneData\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        recordId\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        relationshipData\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n            \n                Properties\n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        addressData\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        addressData:     Array\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :     Array\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    An array of addresses associated with the record that are formatted for readability.

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\nDo not edit the class manually.\n\n            \n\n\n        \n            Index\n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Properties\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        entityType\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        recordCount\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        recordsWithDataSourceCount\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        recordsWithRecordIdCount\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n            \n                Properties\n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        entityType\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        entityType:         string\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         string\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The entity type code identifying the entity type for which the statistics are being provided.

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto

is the Senzing REST API.  It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto

REST API.  It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\nDo not edit the class manually.\n\n            \n\n\n        \n            Index\n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Properties\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        dataSource\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        recordId\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n            \n                Properties\n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        dataSource\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        dataSource:         string\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         string\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The data source code that uniquely identifies the data source associated with the record.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        recordId\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        recordId:         string\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         string\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The record ID that uniquely identifies a record within the respective data source.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n            \n    \n\n\n    \n        export interface SzFocusRecordId {\n  /**\n   * The data source code that uniquely identifies the data source associated with the record.\n   */\n  dataSource?: string;\n  /**\n   * The record ID that uniquely identifies a record within the respective data source.\n   */\n  recordId?: string;\n}\n\n    \n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"interfaces/SzLicenseInfo.html":{"url":"interfaces/SzLicenseInfo.html","title":"interface - SzLicenseInfo","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Interfaces\n  SzLicenseInfo\n\n\n\n        \n            Info\n        \n        \n            Source\n        \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            File\n        \n        \n            projects/rest-api-client-ng/src/lib/model/szLicenseInfo.ts\n        \n\n            \n                Description\n            \n            \n                Senzing REST API\nThis is the Senzing REST API.

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\nDo not edit the class manually.\n\n            \n\n\n        \n            Index\n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Properties\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        id\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        src\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n            \n                Properties\n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        id\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        id:         string\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         string\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The record ID that uniquely identifies a record within the respective data source.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        src\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        src:         string\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         string\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The data source code that uniquely identifies the data source associated with the record.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n            \n    \n\n\n    \n        export interface SzRecordId {\n  /**\n   * The data source code that uniquely identifies the data source associated with the record.\n   */\n  src?: string;\n  /**\n   * The record ID that uniquely identifies a record within the respective data source.\n   */\n  id?: string;\n}\n\n    \n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"interfaces/SzRecordResponse.html":{"url":"interfaces/SzRecordResponse.html","title":"interface -

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\nDo not edit the class manually.\n\n            \n\n\n        \n            Index\n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Properties\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        activeConfigId\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        adminEnabled\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        concurrency\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        dynamicConfig\n                                \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        readOnly\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n            \n                Properties\n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        activeConfigId\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        activeConfigId:         number\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         number\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The active configuration ID being used by the API server.

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse) https://docs.senzing.com\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto

name scoring details\nAdded SzSearchFeatureScore for search feature scores\nModified SzBaseRelatedEntity to remove fullNameScore field since it has\nnot been populated since switch to version 2.0.0 of native Senzing SDK and\nnever made sense in the \"base class\" since only SzAttributeSearchResult had\nthis field populated under native Senzing SDK version 1.x.\nAdded bestNameScore field to SzAttributeSearchResult to replace\nfullNameScore in the place where the name score was previously\nused with version 1.x of the native Senzing SDK (i.e.: to sort search results\nbased on the strength of the name match).\nModified SzAttributeSearchResult to include the featureScores field to\nprovide feature scores without using \"raw data\"\nAdded nameScoringDetails field to SzFeatureScore class to provide\nSzNameScoring name scoring details on why operations,\nUpdated com.senzing.api.model.SzFeatureScore to define its score field as \nthe most sensible score value from the nameScoringDetails for \"NAME\"\nfeatures since the FULL_SCORE field is not available for names.\nAdded the NOT_SCORED value for SzScoringBucket enum.\n\n[2.1.0] - 2020-9-20\nMaintenance release for framework upgrade to
