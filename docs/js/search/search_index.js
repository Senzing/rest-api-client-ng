An application may exclude displaying these as options if these things are being auto-generated or automatically selected for the user.

@senzing/sdk-components-ng.\nThis project should conform to the OAS schema defined in Senzing/senzing-rest-api\nInstallation\nnpm install @senzing/rest-api-client-ng --saveBuilding from source\ngit clone git@github.com:Senzing/rest-api-client-ng.git\ncd rest-api-client-ng\nnpm install\nnpm run build\nnpm run packageThe steps above will checkout the repo and build the package to the ./dist/@senzing/rest-api-client-ng directory. The local package can then be statically installed by using first changing to the directory of your project and doing a npm install ./relative/path/to/dist/@senzing/rest-api-client-ng/rest-api-client-ng.0.0.0.tgz or npm link.\nRunning unit tests\nRun npm run test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\n                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.
