An application may exclude displaying these as options if these things are being auto-generated or automatically selected for the user.

package that provides a Angular TypeScript REST client intended to be used as a dependency for other Senzing projects like @senzing/sdk-components-ng.\nThis project should conform to the OAS schema

NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave the similarly to its stand operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)\nOpenAPI spec version: 1.8.0\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\nDo not edit the class manually.\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                        SzBulkDataStatus:     \"NOT_STARTED\" | \"IN_PROGRESS\" | \"ABORTED\" | \"COMPLETED\"\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n    projects/rest-api-client-ng/src/lib/model/szEntityClassDescriptor.ts\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        SzEntityClassDescriptor\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Describes an entity class either as only its entity class code or as an SzEntityClass object.\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                        SzEntityClassDescriptor:     string | SzEntityClass\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n    projects/rest-api-client-ng/src/lib/model/szRelationshipType.ts\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        SzRelationshipType\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Senzing REST API\nThis is the Senzing REST API.
